1- Create a variable called carName, assign the value Volvo to it.

let carName = "Volvo";

2-Create a variable called x, assign the value 50 to it.
let x = 50

3-Display the sum of 5 10, using two variables: x and y.
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + y;

4-Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result in an alert box.
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = x + y;
alert(z);

5-On one single line, declare three variables with the following names and values:
firstName = "John"

7-Divide 10 by 2, and alert the result:
alert(10 / 2);

8-Alert the remainder when 15 is divided by 9.
alert(15% 9);

9-Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 15 (same as x = x + y).
x = 10;
y = 5;
x += y;

10-Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 50 (same as x = x * y).
x = 10;
y = 5;
x *=
y;

11-Use comments to describe the correct data type of the following variables:
let length = 16;
// Number
let lastName = "Johnson"; // String
const x = {
firstName: "John",
lastName: "Doe"
};
// Object

12-Execute the function named myFunction.
function myFunction() { alert("Hello World!"); }
myFunction();

13-Create a function called "myFunction".

const person = {
name: "John", age: 50
};
 alert(person.name + is person.age);

19-The <button> element should do something when someone clicks on it. Try to fix it!
<button onclick="alert('Hello')">Click me.</button>
